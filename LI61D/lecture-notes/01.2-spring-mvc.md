# Spring MVC

## Introduction

Spring MVC is a library/framework for handling HTTP requests, providing higher level features on top of the [Java Servlet API](https://javaee.github.io/servlet-spec/).

Its design is based on:
- Usage of an underlying servlet server, such as [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/), [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), or [Undertow](https://undertow.io/undertow-docs/undertow-docs-1.2.0/).
- A _dispatch servlet_ that is registered on top of that servlet server, for all paths below a base path, which can be `/`.
- User-defined _request handlers_ that are responsible for processing the requests for specific request mappings, typically defined via HTTP methods and path templates.
  - One way of defining handlers is via instance methods in _controller_ classes.
- A pipeline between the _dispatch servlet_ and the user-defined handers, which:
  - Retrieves information from the request and makes it available to the handlers.
  - Takes data returned by the handler and projects it into the response.
  - Performs pre and post computations on the request and response messages, before and after the handlers being executed.

## Argument binding

Controllers classes and handler methods don't have to fulfill specific interfaces or method signatures:
- A controller is just a class annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController`.
- An handler method is just an instance method inside a controller, without rigid signature requirements.
  
Argument binding is the mechanism by which Spring MVC computes the arguments to pass to the handlers, tipically based on information available in the request message.

## Message conversion

Message conversion is responsible for translating HTTP messages payloads into objects and vice-versa.
Spring MVC already provides built-in message converters for producing and consuming payloads in the JSON format, using the [Jackson library](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).
It is also possible to add custom message converters by implementing the `HttpMessageConverter` interface, or extending from associated base classes.

See [Examples](https://github.com/isel-leic-daw/2021v-public/tree/main/LI61D/code/jvm/spring-demo/src/main/kotlin/pt/isel/daw/spring/demo)

## Generic pipeline processing

There are two distinct ways of adding code to be executed before and after the handler execution:
- Servlet filters.
- Handler interceptors.

Servlet filters are a mechanism defined by the [Java Servlet API](https://javaee.github.io/servlet-spec/) and allow for code to be executed before and after the servlet is called. They can also _short-circuit_ the request, by immediatly ending the request processing without the servlet being called.
Servlet filters don't have access to Spring-specific information.

Handler interceptors are a Spring-specific mechanim to intercept the call to the request handlers, i.e., to have code running before and after the handler invocation.
In comparison with servlet filters, they have the advantage of being able to access handler information. However they have two disadvantages:
- They run later in the pipeline, after the dispatcher servlet.
- They have a less flexible model, in our opinion.
