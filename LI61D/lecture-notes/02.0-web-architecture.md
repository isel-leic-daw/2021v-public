# API design

Designing network API that take advantage of the Web design styles and technologies.

## The architecture of the World Wide Web

[Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/)

> The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI).

Notice:
- "information space"
- The items of that information space are referred to as _resources.
- Resources are identified by URIs - _Uniform Resource Identifiers_

What are resources?
- Anything in the information space that deserves or needs to be identified.
- Example of resouces on an academic information space
  - courses, classes, timeschedules, workassignments, teachers, students, users - i.e. _data-like_ things.
  - enroll a student on a class, create a git repo for a workassignment - i.e. _operation-like_ things.
  
> By design a URI identifies one resource. We do not limit the scope of what might be a resource. The term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be identified by a URI.

The three architectural bases of the Web:

> ...the three architectural bases of the Web that are discussed in this document:
> - Identification - URIs are used to identify resources.
> - Interaction - Web agents communicate using standardized protocols that enable interaction through the exchange of messages which adhere to a defined syntax and semantics.
> - Formats - Most protocols used for representation retrieval and/or submission make use of a sequence of one or more messages, which taken together contain a payload of representation data and metadata, to transfer the representation between agents.

### Identitication and URIs

URIs are globals
- E.g. The _local_ identifier `40123` may be used to identify a ISEL student or an ISCAL student, or a postbox, or a citizen, or a row in a table. The meaning of the identifier is _local_ to the context where it is used.
- E.g. `https://isel.pt/students/40123` is a _global_ identifier. For instance, a user-agent doesn't need additional information to request a _representation_ of this resource.

URIs have an uniform format, however can have multiple schemas. All these are examples of URIs with different schemas (taken from Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/)).

ldap://ldap.example.org/c=GB?objectClass?one
urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog
```

> Good practice: URI opacity
> Agents making use of URIs SHOULD NOT attempt to infer properties of the referenced resource.
[link](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pr-uri-opacity)

E.g. `https://example.com/somethings/new` should not be inferred as an URI to a resource that creates things.

### Interaction

> Communication between agents over a network about resources involves URIs, messages, and data. The Web's protocols (including HTTP, FTP, SOAP, NNTP, and SMTP) are based on the exchange of messages. A message may include data as well as metadata about a resource (such as the "Alternates" and "Vary" HTTP headers), the message data, and the message itself (such as the "Transfer-encoding" HTTP header). A message may even include metadata about the message metadata (for message-integrity checks, for instance).

On the web we don't make _calls_ - we send and receive messages.
Behare of the procedure mindset when reasoning about Web-based systems:
- Different failure modes (messages can be lost, connections may be refused, DNS lookups can fail).
- Different security boundaries and trust levels.
  - On an intra-process procedure call both the caller and the callee are associated to the same identity.
  - On an inter-machine message exchange, the agents may belong to different authorities.
- Different implementation technologies.
  - Interacting agents don't necessarely share implementation technology.


One of the main protocols is the HTTP protocol and we will be focusing on it later on.

### Formats

> A representation is data that encodes information about resource state.
> Representations of a resource may be sent or received using interaction protocols. These protocols in turn determine the form in which representations are conveyed on the Web. HTTP, for example, provides for transmission of representations as octet streams typed using Internet media types [RFC2046].


### Orthogonal specifications

> Identification, interaction, and representation are orthogonal concepts, meaning that technologies used for identification, interaction, and representation may evolve independently. For instance:
>
>    Resources are identified with URIs. URIs can be published without building any representations of the resource or determining whether any representations are available.
>    A generic URI syntax allows agents to function in many cases without knowing specifics of URI schemes.
>    In many cases one may change the representation of a resource without disrupting references to the resource (for example, by using content negotiation).

E.g. The HTTP protocol is not bound to a specific format (e.g. HTML, XML, JSON). 
Instead, the HTTP protocol uses the concept of media-type to identify the format used on the representations.

See the [IANA media type registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)

[IANA](https://www.iana.org/) is the Internet Assigned Number Authority and manages a set of _registries_ with Web _things/concepts_, such as:
- The [media type registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
- The [message headers registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml).
- The [HTTP method registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml).
