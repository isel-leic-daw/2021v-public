# HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Defined by multiple RFCs:
- [RFC 7231 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231)
  - Defines the message semantics, independently of how messages are communicated.
- [RFC 7230 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230)
  - Defines a way to represent messages as bytes and communicate those messages.
- [RFC 7540 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540)
  - Defines an alternative way to represent messages and communicate them over the network.

HTTP/2 still uses the same message semantics defined on RFC 7231

> This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics
>  of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP
>   version 2 (HTTP/2).  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network
>   resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header
>   field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the
>   same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of
>   representations from servers to clients.

## [RFC 7230 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230)

> HTTP is a generic interface protocol for information systems.  It is
   designed to hide the details of how a service is implemented by
   presenting a uniform interface to clients that is independent of the
   types of resources provided.

> HTTP is a stateless request/response protocol that operates by
   exchanging messages (Section 3) across a reliable transport- or
   session-layer "connection" (Section 6).  An HTTP "client" is a
   program that establishes a connection to a server for the purpose of
   sending one or more HTTP requests.  An HTTP "server" is a program
   that accepts connections in order to service HTTP requests by sending
   HTTP responses.

> The terms "client" and "server" refer only to the roles that these
   programs perform for a particular connection.  The same program might
   act as a client on some connections and a server on others.  The term
   "user agent" refers to any of the various client programs that
   initiate a request, including (but not limited to) browsers, spiders
   (web-based robots), command-line tools, custom applications, and
   mobile apps.  The term "origin server" refers to the program that can
   originate authoritative responses for a given target resource.  The
   terms "sender" and "recipient" refer to any implementation that sends
   or receives a given message, respectively.

### Intermediaries

> HTTP enables the use of intermediaries to satisfy requests through a
   chain of connections.  There are three common forms of HTTP
   intermediary: proxy, gateway, and tunnel.

- Proxy

> A "proxy" is a message-forwarding agent that is selected by the
   client, usually via local configuration rules, to receive requests
   for some type(s) of absolute URI and attempt to satisfy those
   requests via translation through the HTTP interface.  Some
   translations are minimal, such as for proxy requests for "http" URIs,
   whereas other requests might require translation to and from entirely
   different application-level protocols.  Proxies are often used to
   group an organization's HTTP requests through a common intermediary
   for the sake of security, annotation services, or shared caching.
   Some proxies are designed to apply transformations to selected
   messages or payloads while they are being forwarded, as described in
   Section 5.7.2.

- Gateway (also called reverse-proxy)

> A "gateway" (a.k.a. "reverse proxy") is an intermediary that acts as
   an origin server for the outbound connection but translates received
   requests and forwards them inbound to another server or servers.
   Gateways are often used to encapsulate legacy or untrusted
   information services, to improve server performance through
   "accelerator" caching, and to enable partitioning or load balancing
   of HTTP services across multiple machines.

- Common use cases
  - Caching
  - Network isolation (external clients "see" the gateway and not the origin servers)
  - Load balancing
    - IP-level
    - HTTP-level
  - Access control (e.g. access token verification)

- Tunnel

> A "tunnel" acts as a blind relay between two connections without
   changing the messages.  Once active, a tunnel is not considered a
   party to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel might have been
   initiated by an HTTP request.

## [RFC 7231 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231)

> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
> level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
> systems.  This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages,
> as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response
> status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of
> messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content
> negotiation.

Notice:
- stateless
- application-level
- semantics of messages

> Each Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) message is either a request
> or a response.  A server listens on a connection for a request,
> parses each message received, interprets the message semantics in
> relation to the identified request target, and responds to that
> request with one or more response messages.  A client constructs
> request messages to communicate specific intentions, examines
> received responses to see if the intentions were carried out, and
> determines how to interpret the results.

## Uniform interface

> HTTP provides a uniform interface for interacting with a resource
> (Section 2), regardless of its type, nature, or implementation, via
> the manipulation and transfer of representations (Section 3).

> Unlike distributed objects, the standardized request methods in HTTP
> are not resource-specific, since uniform interfaces provide for
> better visibility and reuse in network-based systems [REST].

The semantics of a method does not depend on target resource.
This uniformity extends to other HTTP concepts, such as status codes or message headers - their semantics doesn't depend on the target resources.

> What makes HTTP significantly different from RPC is that the requests are directed to resources using a generic interface with standard semantics that can be interpreted by intermediaries almost as well as by the machines that originate services. The result is an application that allows for layers of transformation and indirection that are independent of the information origin, which is very useful for an Internet-scale, multi-organization, anarchically scalable information system. RPC mechanisms, in contrast, are defined in terms of language APIs, not network-based applications.

In [Architectural Styles and
the Design of Network-based Software Architecture](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_5_2)

>  HTTP is not designed to be a transport protocol. It is a transfer protocol in which the messages reflect the semantics of the Web architecture by performing actions on resources through the transfer and manipulation of representations of those resources. It is possible to achieve a wide range of functionality using this very simple interface, but following the interface is required in order for HTTP semantics to remain visible to intermediaries.
>
> That is why HTTP goes through firewalls. Most of the recently proposed extensions to HTTP, aside from WebDAV [60], have merely used HTTP as a way to move other application protocols through a firewall, which is a fundamentally misguided idea. Not only does it defeat the purpose of having a firewall, but it won't work for the long term because firewall vendors will simply have to perform additional protocol filtering. It therefore makes no sense to do those extensions on top of HTTP, since the only thing HTTP accomplishes in that situation is to add overhead from a legacy syntax. A true application of HTTP maps the protocol user's actions to something that can be expressed using HTTP semantics, thus creating a network-based API to services which can be understood by agents and intermediaries without any knowledge of the application.

## Resources

> The target of an HTTP request is called a "resource".  HTTP does not
   limit the nature of a resource; it merely defines an interface that
   might be used to interact with resources.  Each resource is
   identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), as described in
   Section 2.7 of [RFC7230].

## Message Structure

Request message:
  - Method - defines the operation being requested by the message.
  - Request URI - defines the resource where the operation should be performed.
  - Request headers - provide extra information about the request.
  - Request payload (headers + body)

Response message:
  - status code - comunicates the operation outcome.
  - response headers - provide extra information about the response.
  - request payload (headers + body)

Consider the following message with the class diagram for the classes representing HTTP request and response messages in .NET.

![ASP.NET Web API Message class model](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-evolvable-web/9781449337919/images/dewa_1001.png)

Notice:
- The `HttpRequestMessage` has references to `HttpContent` and `HttpRequestHeaders`.
- The `HttpResponseMessage` has references to `HttpContent` and `HttpResponseHeaders`.
- The payload headers, such as `Content-Type` are referenced from `HttpContent` and not directly from `HttpRequestMessage` or `HttpResponsMessage` because they are payload headers and not message headers.

## Representations and payloads

> For the purposes of HTTP, a "representation" is information that is
   intended to reflect a past, current, or desired state of a given
   resource, in a format that can be readily communicated via the
   protocol, and that consists of a set of representation metadata and a
   potentially unbounded stream of representation data.

Notice the
> consists of a set of representation metadata and a
   potentially unbounded stream of representation data.

Message payload = payload headers + payload body

> Some HTTP messages transfer a complete or partial representation as
   the message "payload".  In some cases, a payload might contain only
   the associated representation's header fields (e.g., responses to
   HEAD) or only some part(s) of the representation data (e.g., the 206
   (Partial Content) status code).

The meaning of the payload on a request message depends on the request method

> The purpose of a payload in a request is defined by the method
   semantics.  For example, a representation in the payload of a PUT
   request (Section 4.3.4) represents the desired state of the target
   resource if the request is successfully applied, whereas a
   representation in the payload of a POST request (Section 4.3.3)
   represents information to be processed by the target resource.

> In a response, the payload's purpose is defined by both the request
   method and the response status code.  For example, the payload of a
   200 (OK) response to GET (Section 4.3.1) represents the current state
   of the target resource, as observed at the time of the message
   origination date (Section 7.1.1.2), whereas the payload of the same
   status code in a response to POST might represent either the
   processing result or the new state of the target resource after
   applying the processing.  Response messages with an error status code
   usually contain a payload that represents the error condition, such
   that it describes the error state and what next steps are suggested
   for resolving it.


## Methods

> The request method token is the primary source of request semantics;
   it indicates the purpose for which the client has made this request
   and what is expected by the client as a successful result.

> The request method's semantics might be further specialized by the
   semantics of some header fields when present in a request (Section 5)
   if those additional semantics do not conflict with the method.  For
   example, a client can send conditional request header fields
   (Section 5.2) to make the requested action conditional on the current
   state of the target resource ([RFC7232]).

> HTTP was originally designed to be usable as an interface to
   distributed object systems.  The request method was envisioned as
   applying semantics to a target resource in much the same way as
   invoking a defined method on an identified object would apply
   semantics.

> Unlike distributed objects, the standardized request methods in HTTP
   are not resource-specific, since uniform interfaces provide for
   better visibility and reuse in network-based systems [REST].  Once
   defined, a standardized method ought to have the same semantics when
   applied to any resource, though each resource determines for itself
   whether those semantics are implemented or allowed.

Methods defined on RFC 7231
- `GET`
- `HEAD`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `DELETE`
- `CONNECT`
- `OPTIONS`
- `TRACE`

However, more HTTP methods can be define in additional specifications
- E.g. [RFC 5789 - PATCH Method for HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789)

### Common method properties

#### Safe methods

> Request methods are considered "safe" if their defined semantics are
   essentially read-only; i.e., the client does not request, and does
   not expect, any state change on the origin server as a result of
   applying a safe method to a target resource.  Likewise, reasonable
   use of a safe method is not expected to cause any harm, loss of
   property, or unusual burden on the origin server.

> The purpose of distinguishing between safe and unsafe methods is to
   allow automated retrieval processes (spiders) and cache performance
   optimization (pre-fetching) to work without fear of causing harm.


#### Idempotent methods

> A request method is considered "idempotent" if the intended effect on
   the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the
   same as the effect for a single such request.  Of the request methods
   defined by this specification, PUT, DELETE, and safe request methods
   are idempotent.

> Idempotent methods are distinguished because the request can be
   repeated automatically if a communication failure occurs before the
   client is able to read the server's response.  For example, if a
   client sends a PUT request and the underlying connection is closed
   before any response is received, then the client can establish a new
   connection and retry the idempotent request.  It knows that repeating
   the request will have the same intended effect, even if the original
   request succeeded, though the response might differ.

### Cacheable methods

> Request methods can be defined as "cacheable" to indicate that
   responses to them are allowed to be stored for future reuse; for
   specific requirements see [RFC7234].  In general, safe methods that
   do not depend on a current or authoritative response are defined as
   cacheable; this specification defines GET, HEAD, and POST as
   cacheable, although the overwhelming majority of cache
   implementations only support GET and HEAD.

### Method definitions

> The GET method requests transfer of a current selected representation
   for the target resource.

> The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT
   send a message body in the response (i.e., the response terminates at
   the end of the header section).  The server SHOULD send the same
   header fields in response to a HEAD request as it would have sent if
   the request had been a GET, except that the payload header fields
   (Section 3.3) MAY be omitted.

> The POST method requests that the target resource process the
   representation enclosed in the request according to the resource's
   own specific semantics.

Note the "according to the resource's own specific semantics"

> The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be
   created or replaced with the state defined by the representation
   enclosed in the request message payload.

> The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the
   association between the target resource and its current
   functionality.

> The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to
   the destination origin server identified by the request-target and,
   if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding
   of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.

> The OPTIONS method requests information about the communication
   options available for the target resource, at either the origin
   server or an intervening intermediary.

The `OPTIONS` is used by the CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) protocol.

> The TRACE method requests a remote, application-level loop-back of
   the request message.  The final recipient of the request SHOULD
   reflect the message received, excluding some fields described below,
   back to the client as the message body of a 200 (OK) response with a
   Content-Type of "message/http" (Section 8.3.1 of [RFC7230]).

## Status codes

> The status-code element is a three-digit integer code giving the
   result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.

> HTTP status codes are extensible.  HTTP clients are not required to
   understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable.  However, a client MUST
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to
   the x00 status code of that class, with the exception that a
   recipient MUST NOT cache a response with an unrecognized status code.

> The first digit of the status-code defines the class of response.
   The last two digits do not have any categorization role.  There are
   five values for the first digit:
>
>   -  1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
>
>   -  2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received,
>      understood, and accepted
>
>   -  3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to
>      complete the request
>
>   -  4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
>      fulfilled
>
>   -  5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently
>      valid request

Some notes from [How to Think About HTTP Status Codes](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2017/05/11/status_codes)

> It’s also important to understand that status codes are defined to be potentially applicable to every HTTP resource; we say that they have generic semantics (just like HTTP methods).
>
> Knowing that explains some of the confusion; mapping an application’s specific semantics onto a set of universally generic semantics is a difficult, error-prone process. Trying to make your application “fit” into a set of status codes is only going to cause pain and disappointment. Don’t do it.
>
> It’s unfortunately common to see specs try to do this by saying things like “a 200 OK on the /foo resource means that the widget has been ordered” or “a 404 Not Found on a widget means that the widget is back-ordered.” This is effectively re-defining the semantics of the status code (remember: generic), thereby effectively creating a private version of HTTP, and is effectively a code smell (but for protocols).
>
> Or, we’ve all seen HTTP “APIs” that try to list every resource and the possible status codes they could generate; this is well-intentioned, but bad practice. The set of status codes that a client can potentially encounter is much larger than the handful they list, because a proxy might be configured, or the server might generate a 421 Misdirected Request, or a 429 Too Many Requests, or a nice, zesty 500 Internal Server Error.

> The right place to put application-specific semantics is in the body’s format. In most cases, you won’t need to specify the status code that is used with it; “successful response” is probably enough. You might also create some HTTP headers to go along with it; doing that’s out of scope here.
>
> For errors (4xx and 5xx), you can use this format [RFC 7807] if you don’t want to create your own.
