## Guidelines

- Duration: 25 minutes
  - Presentation: up to 15 minutes.
  - Questions & answers: minumum of 10 minutes.
- The presentation should:
  - Demonstrate the working parts of the project, with emphasis on the second part.
    - E.g.
      - Providing credentials.
      - Creating projects.
      - Listing projects.
      - Seeing the details of a project.
      - Deleting a project
    - Avoid repeting similar parts.
  - Highlight the non-trival technical parts of the solution.
    - E.g.
      - How are credentials stored and made available to the HTTP requesting code.
      - How are HTTP requests performed.
      - How are HTTP forms handled.
      - How are errors handled.

      - How is hypermedia used.
  - Avoid repeating _things_ that were presented in the classes.
    - E.g.
      - Do not describe how `useFetch` works.
  - Identify the main design decisions regarding how the code base is structured.
- Manage the presentation time wisely. Make sure it is well used to highligh the valuable parts of your solution.
- Add a document to the repo with a summary of this presentation, with pointers to the relevant parts of the code or technical documentation.
