# DAW Project #

## Phase 2 requirements

Create an user interface for the _project issue management system_, running in the browser and using exclusively the HTTP API developed for phase 1 (except for loading static content such as HTML, javascript and images).
If required, the HTTP API can be improved.

* The user interface should allow the usage of the complete functionality exposed by the HTTP API.
* All operations should require user authentication, still using the HTTP Basic scheme required for the first phase.
  * The user interface should include a login screen to capture the user's credentials, which will be used on all requests.
  * The user interface should include a logout action to erase the user's credentials at the client side.
* Support for browser navigation, bookmarking, and deep-linking is highly valued.
* Support for the API evolvability via hypermedia support on the client is highly valued.

## Delivery

* This phase 2 must be delivered until June 12 (end of week 12) via the creation of a `0.2.0` tag on the GitHub repository.
